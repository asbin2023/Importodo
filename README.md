<h1 align="center">Importodo - Todo List App</h1>

## Introduction

Importodo is a simple and interactive todo list application built with React. It allows you to manage your tasks efficiently by keeping track of your todo items, completed tasks, and important todos. Add, complete, and prioritize tasks with ease!

## Features

- Add new todo items and prevent duplicates.
- Mark tasks as completed and view them in the "Completed" section.
- Delete tasks to remove them from the list.
- Prioritize tasks by marking them as important.
- Display or hide completed tasks as needed.
- Sort tasks by importance to focus on what matters most.

## Local Storage

Importodo is equipped with local storage support, which means your todo list will be saved even after refreshing the page or closing the browser. You can seamlessly pick up where you left off with your tasks, making it convenient for daily use.

## Drag and Drop

The drag and drop feature allows you to easily rearrange the order of your todo items. Simply click and hold an item, then drag it to a new position in the list. The updated order will be automatically saved to local storage, so your custom arrangement persists across sessions.

## Toggle Button

The "Toggle Completed" button enables you to show or hide completed tasks in the "Completed" section. This allows you to keep your todo list tidy and focused on what's pending. Click the button to switch between displaying and hiding completed tasks.
